# Yelp-Project
Data Mining and NLP project

With this project we were trying to do our bit in helping improve health; and are happy that we got a positive outcome. We not only identified the restaurants which might violate the health code with 78% accuracy, but also gave tips in the form of checklists to
the health inspectors. These checklists were derived by processing the reviews written by users and analyzing their topics and sentiments.

Toolkits like NLTK and Gensim were used to achieve that end.
